WHAT'S NEW
==========
 
 - SwiPICs updated to support SWI-Prolog Version 8.0.3-1 32bit and 64bit

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

			An interface from .Net languages to SWI-Prolog

This library is a .Net (CSharp) interface to SWI-Prolog. The described  
interface provides a layer around the C-interface for natural programming from C#. 
The interface deals with automatic type-conversion to and from Prolog, mapping of
exceptions and making queries to Prolog in an easy way. There is a call-back from 
Prolog to C#.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you want to compile SwiplCs only the project SwiPlCs is needed.

To work with Visual Studio install 'Visual Studio Tools for Git' 
in the Tools - 'Extensions and Updates' menu and connect to 
https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/contrib-swiplcs

Add the following lines to .git\info\exlude if you like to commit something
	*.sdf
	*.opensdf

SWI_HOME_DIR has to be set as an environment variable to the SWI-Prolog installation Path.

PATH the bin directory of SWI-Prolog has to be added to the PATH environment variable.


Compiler switches
-----------------

The following compiler switches are in the sources:

- _PL_X64        Maintained by the project files (.csproj). If defined a 64-bit version 
                 is compiled
- _LINUX         Not maintained!
- _DEBUG         in SWI-cs-PlQuery.cs. Write an Exception to the Console / trace window. 
                 The release version throw the Exception.
- USE_PRINT_MESSAGE debugging purpose in exceptions.cs


Build binaries
--------------
To Build the binaries the batch script build_bin_package.bat in the project SwiPlCs-Documentation can be used.
Therefor  winrar must be installed at c:\programme\winrar\winrar and the Sandcastle Help File Builder (shfb) must be installed.


64-Bit
------
To run the test on a 64-Bit environment got to the Test menu 
- 'Test settings' - 'Default Processor Architecture' - chose X64



Known BUGs
----------

64-Bit:

- test cases for Prolog call back with war args (t_varargs_single, t_varargs) are *not* running
  see remarks on DelegateParameterVarArgs in SWI-cs.cs
