			An interface from .Net languages to SWI-Prolog

This library is a .Net (CSharp) interface to SWI-Prolog. The described  
interface provides a layer around the C-interface for natural programming from C#. 
The interface deals with automatic type-conversion to and from Prolog, mapping of
exceptions and making queries to Prolog in an easy way. There is a call-back from 
Prolog to C#.
