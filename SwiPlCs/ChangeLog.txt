1.1.60605.0 
- Test cases are running against SWI-Prolog version 6.6.5.
- Sources are available on https://github.com/SWI-Prolog/contrib-swiplcs
- binaries on http://www.lesta.de/prolog/swiplcs/download/index.htm
- Hopefully completely Unicode capable (Thanks to wchars functions).
- A lot of code cleanup.
- BREAKING CHANGE: Libpl is an internal class now.

1.1.60604.0 pre release Unicode
	- PlTerm.PlCompound is Obsolete. Please use new PlTerm(string) instead.

1.1.60601.0 pre release -> 60602.0
	- Change  public PlQuery(string module, string goal)
	    it is based now on read_term_from_atom/ not any more on read_term and the redirection of the input stream.
	- PlTerm(text), PlCompound(text) and PlQuery(goal) are using now PL_wchars_to_term instead of PL_chars_to_term
	- also all ToString Methods relay on an Utf8 encoding which seems to work for all Unicode (and other) characters

1.1.60301.0
- CHANGE type uint (term_t) to a struct uintptr_t which is UInt64 if _PL_X64 is defined or UInt32 
- BREAKING CHANGE: SWI-PROLOG has changed the name of swipl.dll to libswipl.dll
- ADDED Linux Support with Mono from Batu Akan. Uncomment the #define _LINUX in NativeMethods.cs and compile the sources. (untested)
- Added a constructor of PlTermV with an argument of PlTerm[] array.
- Port to a VS2010 solution
- ADDED the F# sample from Foutelet Joel.
- FIX: Unicode character encoding in PlTerm.ToString() (PL_get_chars/3 now with libpl.REP_MB)
- Speed up PlTerm.ToStringCanonical() by using PL_get_chars/3 with 
  the new CVT_WRITE_CANONICAL flag. Thanks to Jan.
- FIX: PlDetachEngine (wrong pointer)
- change some test cases to reflect SWI-Prolog changes. E.g. ToString() 
  of a term foo(a, b) return foo(a,b), (without the space)
