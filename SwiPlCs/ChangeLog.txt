1.1.60604.0 pre release unicode
	- PlTerm.PlCompound is Obsolete. Please use new PlTerm(string) instead.

1.1.60601.0 pre release -> 60602.0
	- Change  public PlQuery(string module, string goal)
	    it is based now on read_term_from_atom/ not any more on read_term and the redirection of the input stream.
	- PlTerm(text), PlCompound(text) and PlQuery(goal) are using now PL_wchars_to_term istead of PL_chars_to_term
	- also all ToString Methods relay on an Utf8 encoding which seems to work for all unicode (and othe) characters
