Hi,

I'm receiving many mails on gollem.science.uva.nl being down. This is
related mainly to network hardware issues after the department moved to
another building.

I have found a more permanent and probably better maintained location at
the prolog.cs.vu.nl.

Status:

	* GIT repositories have been moved to

		- git://prolog.cs.vu.nl/home/pl/git/pl.git
		- git://prolog.cs.vu.nl/home/pl/git/pl-57x.git

	The host has changed and /home/pl/X.git --> /home/pl/git/X.git
	This is now online and up-to-date and this will be the main
	location of the gits from now on.
	
	To update, clone again or edit .git/config and change the url
	for the `origin' remote.  You also need to update the submodules
	and the submodule configs, so if you have a high-bandwidth link,
	cloning might be easier.

	For people with commit rights, I'll copy the accounts from 
	gollem when I get access to them again.

	* There is a new website at http://prolog.cs.vu.nl.  This site
	actually runs on SWI-Prolog!  It still looks a bit ugly and not
	all download files are there (I will copy them from gollem as
	soon as this is up again).  I didn't plan to make it public yet,
	but better an ugly site than no site.

	Eventually, www.swi-prolog.org will simply redirect here.

	* Bug-reporting is still on gollem (and thus unreachable for now).

Unclear is what will happen to the wiki. I think the best is to move the
interesting stuff to the new site and close it. The new website is in
the git plweb.git, so you can run it locally, improve it and send me
patches.

	Cheers --- Jan
